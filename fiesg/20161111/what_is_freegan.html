            <h1>What is a Freegan?</h1>
            <p>
                Freegans are people who employ alternative strategies for 
                living based on limited participation in the conventional 
                economy and minimal consumption of resources. 
                Freegans embrace community, generosity, social concern, 
                freedom, cooperation, and sharing in opposition to a society 
                based on materialism, moral apathy, competition, conformity, 
                and greed.
            </p>
            <p>
                After years of trying to boycott products from unethical 
                corporations responsible for human rights violations, 
                environmental destruction, and animal abuse, many of us found 
                that no matter what we bought we ended up supporting something 
                deplorable. We came to realize that the problem isn’t just a 
                few bad corporations but the entire system itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freeganism is a total boycott of an economic system where 
                the profit motive has eclipsed ethical considerations and 
                where massively complex systems of productions ensure that 
                all the products we buy will have detrimental impacts most 
                of which we may never even consider. Thus, instead of avoiding 
                the purchase of products from one bad company only to support
                another, we avoid buying anything to the greatest degree 
                we are able.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word freegan is compounded from “free” and “vegan”. 
                Vegans are people who avoid products from animal sources or 
                products tested on animals in an effort to avoid harming
                animals. Freegans take this a step further by recognizing 
                that in a complex, industrial, mass-production economy driven 
                by profit, abuses of humans, animals, and the earth abound at 
                all levels of production (from acquisition to raw materials 
                to production to transportation) and in just about every 
                product we buy. Sweatshop labor, rainforest destruction, 
                global warming, displacement of indigenous communities, 
                air and water pollution, eradication of wildlife on farmland 
                as “pests”, the violent overthrow of popularly elected 
                governments to maintain puppet dictators compliant to 
                big business interests, open-pit strip mining, oil drilling 
                in environmentally sensitive areas, union busting, 
                child slavery, and payoffs to repressive regimes are just 
                some of the many impacts of the seemingly innocuous consumer 
                products we consume every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freegans employ a range of strategies for practical living 
                based on our principles:
            </p>
            <section>
                <h1>Waste Reclamation</h1>
                <p>
                    We live in an economic system where sellers only value 
                    land and commodities relative to their capacity to 
                    generate profit. Consumers are constantly being bombarded 
                    with advertising telling them to discard and replace the 
                    goods they already have because this increases sales. 
                    This practice of affluent societies produces an amount of 
                    waste so enormous that many people can be fed and supported 
                    simply on its trash. As freegans we forage instead of 
                    buying to avoid being wasteful consumers ourselves, 
                    to politically challenge the injustice of allowing vital 
                    resources to be wasted while multitudes lack basic 
                    necessities like food, clothing, and shelter, and to 
                    reduce the waste going to landfills and incinerators 
                    which are disproportionately situated within poor, 
                    non-white neighborhoods, where they cause elevated levels 
                    of cancer and asthma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most notorious freegan strategy is what is 
                    commonly called “urban foraging” or “dumpster diving”. 
                    This technique involves rummaging through the garbage 
                    of retailers, residences, offices, and other facilities 
                    for useful goods. Despite our society’s sterotypes about 
                    garbage, the goods recovered by freegans are safe, useable,
                    clean, and in perfect or near-perfect condition, 
                    a symptom of a throwaway culture that encourages us to 
                    constantly replace our older goods with newer ones, and 
                    where retailers plan high-volume product disposal as part 
                    of their economic model. Some urban foragers go at it alone,
                    others dive in groups, but we always share the discoveries 
                    openly with one another and with anyone along the way who 
                    wants them. Groups like Food Not Bombs recover foods that 
                    would otherwise go to waste and use them to prepare meals 
                    to share in public places with anyone who wishes to partake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By recovering the discards of retailers, offices, schools, 
                    homes, hotels, or anywhere by rummaging through their trash 
                    bins, dumpsters, and trash bags, freegans are able to obtain
                    food, beverages, books, toiletries magazines, comic books, 
                    newspapers, videos, kitchenware, appliances, 
                    music (CDs, cassettes, records, etc.), carpets, 
                    musical instruments, clothing, rollerblades, scooters, 
                    furniture, vitamins, electronics, animal care products, 
                    games, toys, bicycles, artwork, and just about any other 
                    type of consumer good. Rather than contributing to further 
                    waste, freegans curtail garbage and pollution, reducing the
                    over-all volume in the waste stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lots of used items can also be found for free or shared 
                    with others on websites like Freecycle and in the free 
                    section of your local Craigslist. To dispose of useful 
                    materials check out the EPA’s Materials and Waste Exchanges 
                    directory. In communities around the country, people are 
                    holding events like “Really, Really, Free Markets” and 
                    “Freemeets”. These events are akin to flea markets with 
                    free items. People bring items to share with others. 
                    They give and take but not a dollar is exchanged. 
                    When freegans do need to buy, we buy second-hand goods 
                    which reduces production and supports reusing and reducing 
                    what would have been wasted without providing any 
                    additional funds for new production.

                <h1>Waste Minimization</h1>
                <p>
                    Because of our frequent sojourns into the discards our 
                    throwaway society, freegans are very aware of and disgusted 
                    by the enormous amounts of waste the average US consumer 
                    generates and thus choose not to be a part of the problem. 
                    So, freegans scrupulously recycle, compost organic matter 
                    into topsoil, and repair rather than replace items whenever 
                    possible. Anything unusable by us, we redistribute to our 
                    friends, at freemarkets, or using internet services like 
                    freecycle and craigslist.

                <h1>Eco-friendly Transporation</h1>
                <p>
                    Freegans recognize the disastrous social and ecological 
                    impacts of the automobile. We all know that automobiles 
                    cause pollution created from the burning of petroleum but 
                    we usually don’t think of the other destruction factors 
                    like forests being eliminated from road building in 
                    wilderness areas and collision deaths of humans and 
                    wildlife. As well, the massive oil use today creates 
                    the economic impetus for slaughter in Iraq and all over 
                    the world. Therefore, freegans choose not to use cars for 
                    the most part. Rather, we use other methods of 
                    transportation including trainhopping, hitchhiking, 
                    walking, skating, and biking. Hitchhiking fills up room 
                    in a car that would have been unused otherwise and 
                    therefore it does not add to the overall consumption of 
                    cars and gasoline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some freegans find at least some use of cars unavoidable 
                    so we try to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels by 
                    using cars with diesel engines converted to run on 
                    biodiesel or “veggie-oil” literally fueling our cars with 
                    used fryer oil from restaurants – another example of 
                    diverting waste for practical use. Volunteer groups are 
                    forming everywhere to assist people in converting diesel 
                    engines to run on vegetable oil.

                <h1>Rent-free housing</h1>
                <p>
                    Freegans believe that housing is a RIGHT, not a privilege. 
                    Just as freegans consider it an atrocity for people to 
                    starve while food is thrown away, we are also outraged 
                    that people literally freeze to death on the streets 
                    while landlords, banks and cities keep buildings boarded 
                    up and vacant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Squatters are people who occupy and rehabilitate abandoned, 
                    decrepit buildings. Squatters believe that real human needs 
                    are more important than abstract notions of private 
                    property, and that those who hold deed to buildings but 
                    won’t allow people to live in them, even in places where 
                    housing is vitally needed, don’t deserve to own those 
                    buildings. In addition to living areas, squatters often 
                    convert abandoned buildings into community centers with 
                    programs including art activities for children, 
                    environmental education, meetings of community 
                    organizations, and more.

                <h1>Going green</h1>
                <p>
                    We live in a society where the foods that we eat are often
                    grown a world away, overprocessed, and then transported 
                    long distances to be stored for too long, all at a high 
                    ecological cost. Because of this process, we’ve lost 
                    appreciation for the changes in season and the cycles of 
                    life but some of us are reconnecting to the Earth through 
                    gardening and wild foraging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many urban ecologists have been turning garbage-filled 
                    abandoned lots into verdant community garden plots. 
                    In neighborhoods where stores are more likely to carry 
                    junk food than fresh greens, community gardens provide 
                    a health food source. Where the air is choked with asthma 
                    inducing pollutants, the trees in community gardens produce 
                    oxygen. In landscapes dominated by brick, concrete, and 
                    asphalt, community gardens provide an oasis of plants, 
                    open spaces, and places for communities to come together, 
                    work together, share food, grow together, and break down 
                    the barriers that keep people apart in a society where we 
                    have all become too isolated from one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wild foragers demonstrate that we can feed ourselves 
                    without supermarkets and treat our illnesses without 
                    pharmacies by familiarizing ourselves with the edible 
                    and medicinal plants growing all around us. Even city 
                    parks can yield useful foods and medicines, giving us 
                    a renewed appreciation of the reality that our sustenance 
                    comes ultimately not from corporate food producers, 
                    but from the Earth itself. Others take the foraging 
                    lifestyle even farther, removing themselves from urban 
                    and suburban concepts and attempting to “go feral” 
                    by building communities in the wilderness based on 
                    primitive survival skills.

                <h1>Working less</h1>
                <p>
                    How much of our lives do we sacrifice to pay bills 
                    and buy more stuff? For most of us, work means 
                    sacrificing our freedom to take orders from someone else, 
                    stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to our 
                    physical and psychological well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we realize that it’s not a few bad products or a 
                    few egregious companies responsible for the social and 
                    ecological abuses in our world but rather the entire 
                    system we are working in, we begin to realize that, 
                    as workers, we are cogs in a machine of violence, 
                    death, exploitation, and destruction. Is the retail 
                    clerk who rings up a cut of veal any less responsible 
                    for the cruelty of factory farming than the farm worker? 
                    What about the ad designer who finds ways to make the 
                    product palatable? How about the accountant who does 
                    the grocery books and allows it to stay in business? 
                    Or the worker in the factory that manufacturers 
                    refrigerator cases? And, of course, the high level 
                    managers of the corporations bear the greatest 
                    responsibility of all for they make the decisions 
                    which causes the destruction and waste. You don’t have 
                    to own stock in a corporation or own a factory or 
                    chemical plant to be held to blame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By accounting for the basic necessities of food, clothing,
                    housing, furniture, and transportation without spending a 
                    dime, freegans are able to greatly reduce or altogether 
                    eliminate the need to constantly be employed. We can 
                    instead devote our time to caring for our families, 
                    volunteering in our communities, and joining activist 
                    groups to fight the practices of the corporations who 
                    would otherwise be bossing us around at work. For some, 
                    total unemployment isn’t an option it’s far harder to 
                    find free dental surgery than a free bookcase on the curb 
                    but by limiting our financial needs, even those of us 
                    who need to work can place conscious limits on how much 
                    we work, take control of our lives, and escape the constant 
                    pressure to make ends meet. But even if we must work, 
                    we need not cede total control to the bosses. 
                    The freegan spirit of cooperative empowerment can be 
                    extended into the workplace as part of worker-led unions
                    like the Industrial Workers of the World.
