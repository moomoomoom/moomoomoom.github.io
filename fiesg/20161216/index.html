            <h1>School and Education</h1>
            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
            <p>Since most of us spend about 2 decades in the school,
            I believe you must know the school very well,
            and you have something to say.
            So, let's talk about the school and education.

                What is education?
                What is the purpose?
                Should the education server the people or the country?
                private and public personal country 
                freedom not fair not equality
                obligation server to the country fair
                I am thinking about those questions.
            </p>
            <ul>
                What is Education?
                Do we need it?
                Is it should be personal thing or the country?
                use the national resource to build the education system and control it?
                What is the purpose?
                How should we achieve the Education?
                make you think that way
                people who livied in taiwan, who are they? where are they belong?
                in the past they were Ming dynasty, then Qing dynasty,
                then Japanese(Second-class citizen),
                then chinese(ROC), then Taiwanese, then chinese(ROC), then Taiwanese
            </ul>
            <p>
                              
                Through above which i mentioned,
                right now, let's deal with the reality.
                How should we do to achieve the Education
            </p>
            <ul>
                What is a ideal teacher?
                What is a ideal student?
                What is a ideal school?
                What kind of role should the school play in the society,
                in the Education.
            </ul>
            
            <p> adult education
            Sometimes I found people just getiing old,
            but they don't become a better person or mature.
            Also we can get a lot information through the internet now,
            but not everyone has the ability to choose what to believe.
            Time flys things change
            but some people do not change the way of living,
            eg: because of the technonlogy, we can catch more fish than before,
            but we catch too much, people know it, but they don't change their behavir.
            I remember a interview form a fishman, he said even he does not catch those fish,
            other people will still catch the fish. i can understand about this.
            Some people just use the old rule to face the new world,
            teacher is always right, or parents are always right
            we use len to watch some specific people, eg teacher must be perfect person

            i feel this class should not be close in the school
            if everyone in the world can access this kind of interaction
            
            right now, the knowledge is not preivegag of some people
            it is like everyone can access whatever they want
            
            We ask people "How old are you?" and the response "I am 10 years old".
            But in Spanish, we say "Cuantos años tiene?",and the response "tengo 10 años."
            in English is "How many years do you have?", "I have 10 years."
            which make me feel one is we own the time, i have 10 years time.
            another sense is I have 10 years experience about living in the world.

                Should adult keep improving their self or learning something new?
                (it's not about job, it's about the person himself)
                
                What's the difference between keep taking more education and not?
                
                What would the society be?
                
                What would the human being be in the future?
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Is is education or school good?
                Is it a process to train people? like training animal.
                The system want everybody think in some way to maintain the system.
                sometimes I think this way, is it really i think in this way or 
                someone else want me to think in that way?
