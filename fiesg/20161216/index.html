            <h1>School and Education</h1>
            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
            <p>Most of us spent about 2 decades in the school,
            I believe you must know the school very well,
            and you have something to say.
            So, let's talk about the school and education.

            <h2>The past</h2>
            <p>
                As you are an adult now,
                you must recognize that those years means a lot to you for now.
                First part we will walk through your past to know the “old school”,
                also to find out what is your school?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is your school like?</li>
                <li>What is the routine?</li>
                <li>Do you like your school? which part? or not?</li>
                <li>What did you do in the school?</li>
                <li>What do you think about the school in general?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>

                I think we should start this part with one question, 
                “ What is education? ”. The answer may be teach them how to 
                survive in the world, pass some value like respect, being brave,
                sharing, love...etc.
                Or we should help this young people to develop their talent,
                to find out who they are, what they really like to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turns out, in this world, it seems like there are two parts,
                one is for the young human being, the other one is for the adult.
                but then,                
                I feel it's a whole, though we separte these, but they influence each other.
            </p>
            <p>    
                What is the purpose? and, should the education server the people or the country?
                we choose the personal will and the freedom, 
                or the country make the decision for the young people,
                though in the democracy society, it's people's will choose the path.
            </p>
            <p>    
                If the right of education is private property, 
                young people may allow to make their own choice besed on their needs.
                Since it's property,
                it means not everyone can access education or they can only learn from the society.
                is it a disadvantage? even the greatest scientist learned from the nature.
            </p>
            <p>    
                If it's a human right. 
                The country should use their national resource to ensure everyone can have education.
                then it's not just a right but also an obligation, a rule!
                young people lost the freedom to choose, they have to follow the rule,
                they must accept the duty from the country. Nobody can escape from the system.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I am thinking about those questions.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is Education?</li>
                <li>What is the purpose?</li>
                <li>Do we need it?</li>
                <li>Is it should be personal thing or for the country?</li>
                <li>Use the national resource to build the education system and control it?</li>
                <li>How should we achieve the Education?</li>
                <li>make you think that way
                <p>people who livied in taiwan, who are they? where do they belong?
                in the past they were Ming dynasty, then Qing dynasty,
                then Japanese(Second-class citizen),
                then chinese(ROC), then Taiwanese, then chinese(ROC), then Taiwanese.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>What is the purpose?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Ideal reality</h2>
            <p>                              
                After go through the above issue,
                right now, let's deal with the reality.
                What should we do to achieve the Education?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is an ideal teacher?</li>
                <li>What is an ideal student?</li>
                <li>What is a perfect class?</li>
                <li>What kind of role should the school play in the society,
                in the Education?</li>
                <li>How do we build an ideal school?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Adult Education</h2>
            <p>
            Sometimes I found people just getiing old,
            but they don't become a better person or mature.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also we can get a lot information through the internet now,
            but not everyone has the ability to choose what to believe.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time flies, things change.
            But some people do not change the way of living.
            eg: because of the technology, we can catch more fish than we used to,
            but we catch too much, people knew it, but they don't change.
            I remember a interview form a fishman, he said even he does not catch those fish,
            other people will still catch the fish. I can't understand about this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some people only use the old rule or tradition to face the new world, 
            eg:Teacher is always right, or parents are always right, we should respect old man...etc
            The society is picky about some specific people, 
            eg: teacher must be perfect person, girl must be...

            Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do? Episode 01 "THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDER"
            </a>
            the video is a Harvard open class about justice.
            I felt that this class should not be just isolated in the school,
            if everyone in the world can access this kind of interaction,
            make people think more, is it good?
            </p>
            <p>
            Right now, the knowledge is not privilege of some people,
            everyone can access whatever they want via Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
            We ask people "How old are you?" and the response "I am 10 years old".
            But in Spanish, they say "Cuantos años tiene?",and the response "tengo 10 años."
            in English is "How many years do you have?", "I have 10 years."
            which make me feel two idea, 
            it seems like we own the time, i have 10 years of time.
            another sense is I have 10 years experience about living in the world.
            So...
