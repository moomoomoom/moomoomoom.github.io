            <h1>School and Education</h1>
            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
            <p>Since most of us spend about 2 decades in the school,
            I believe you must know the school very well,
            and you have something to say.
            So, let's talk about the school and education.

                What is education?
                What is the purpose?
                Should the education server the people or the country?
                private and public personal country 
                freedom not fair not equality
                obligation server to the country fair
                I am thinking about those questions.

            </ul>
            <p>                              
                Through above i mentioned,
                right now, let's deal with the reality.
                How should we do to achieve the Education
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is a ideal teacher?</li>
                <li>What is a ideal student?</li>
                <li>What is a ideal school?</li>

                in the Education.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>adult education</h2>
            <p>
            Sometimes I found people just getiing old,
            but they don't become a better person or mature.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also we can get a lot information through the internet now,
            but not everyone has the ability to choose what to believe.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time flys things change
            but some people do not change the way of living,
            </p>
            <p>
            eg: because of the technonlogy, we can catch more fish than before,
            but we catch too much, people know it, but they don't change their behavir.
            I remember a interview form a fishman, he said even he does not catch those fish,
            other people will still catch the fish. i can't understand about this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some people just use the old rule to face the new world,
            teacher is always right, or parents are always right
            we use len to watch some specific people, eg teacher must be perfect person

            i feel this class should not be close in the school
            if everyone in the world can access this kind of interaction
            </p>
            <p>
            right now, the knowledge is not preivegag of some people
            it is like everyone can access whatever they want
            </p>
            <p>
            We ask people "How old are you?" and the response "I am 10 years old".
            But in Spanish, we say "Cuantos años tiene?",and the response "tengo 10 años."
            in English is "How many years do you have?", "I have 10 years."
            which make me feel one is we own the time, i have 10 years time.
            another sense is I have 10 years experience about living in the world.
