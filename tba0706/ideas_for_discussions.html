            <h1>Ideas for discussion</h1>
<ol>
<li>
1.The law allow people to get marriaed more than once in the same time.
Ex: King has 3 wives, Queen, Jenny, Freddie. 
    Queen has 3 husbands, King(60yrs), Jonson(40yrs),Yummy(2x yrs).
    Jenny, Freddie, Jonson and Yummy also have their own life partner.
If the law don't rule over love anymore...
what do you think about this situation?

2. Communism and free economy(free market)
(the definition is not 100% correct, just my understanding.)

free market means everyone has right and freedom to choose, 
meanwhile you have to face the consequence by yourself,
the consequence could be bad or good.

Communism means you don't have right and freedom to choose, 
you should work together with each other to gain the public interest, 
if you failed, the society will help you.
Which one whould you choose? Why?
</li>

What do you think about "China Airline strike" and "UK is going to leave EU"?
