            <p>The money is treasured. we can use it to achieve a lot of goals. 
ex: make the life more convenient, help other people.
Though, have you ever think about another treasured thing - the time?</p>
<p>We can make money, we can save money, 
since it's not easy to get money, so we spend it wisely.
However,
we can't make time, we can't save time, 
we get it for free, do you spend your time wisely?</p>

<p>Also it's the only one totally fair thing in the world.
The day starts, we get our own piece.
And the day ends, we must spend it all.
No one have the priviliage to get more,
No one will get less due to the vulnerability.</p>
