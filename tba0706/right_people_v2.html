            <p>Life is short, we don't wnat to waste it.
which lead us to make a lot of decisions.</p>
<p>I have always thought that i should fill the life with only "right people".
People play a big part in our life, they really make the life different.</p>
<p>If life is a journey...
people can help you enjoy the trip, or they can just destroy it.
who will you choose to be your company?</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are your right people?</li>
<li>What do they have in common? Or must they stay together to be the right person?</li>
<li>Why do you choose them?</li>
<li>How do you choose the right people?</li>
<li>Are you one of your right people?</li>
</ol>
<p>extra question:
<ul>
<li>Did you choose to spend time with wrong person or the people who you don't fit in with?</li> 
<li>Would you share the experience with us?</li>
</ul>
</p>
