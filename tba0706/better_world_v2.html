            <p>Hi everyone, since we are 18!
We have been living in this world for some time,
you must know something about this world...
Are you satisfied?</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you make your life better?</li>
<li>How do you make your daily life better? 
(neighborhood, traffic, job...etc)</li>
<li>How do you make the society better?</li>
<li>How do you make this world better?</li>
<li>I believe that one of the goal of life is to make the world better.
What do you think? 
Is it a necessary to us to take action to make the world better?</li>
(use your own definition of better.)
</ol>
