                    Hi, everyone. tonight we will talk about some scenarios 
                    which "I am used to it". 
                    It means that I did not feel it's wrong or abnormal,
                    and even more i did feel it's right.
                    Something that I never ask "why".                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    below it's the list about those scenarios.
